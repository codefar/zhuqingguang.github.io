Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it -powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
The followings are some html codes
<style>
.div {
  background-color: yellow;
  color: red;
}
span {
  float: right;
}
</style>
<div>
<span>float: right;</span>
</div>
